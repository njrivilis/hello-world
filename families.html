    This year, I am teaching 10th and 12th grade vocational programming and web development at Dean Technical High School in Holyoke Massachusetts. 
<br>
<br>
    10th grade students are currently studying fundamentals of computer science, like the parts of a computer, how the internet works, and foundations of JavaScript programming. This builds on their PhotoShop and web design projects from last year and will prepare them for the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles exam next year.
<br>
<br>
    12th grade students are currently learning advanced database skills with SQLite and T-SQL. This builds on their object oriented programming, game design, and web development skills from last year and will prepare them for a career in programming and web development.
