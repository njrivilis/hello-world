    I teach vocational Programming and Web Development at Dean Technical High School, in Holyoke Massachusetts. For the 2020-2021 school year, I am teaching 10th and 12th grade, fully remote. This website showcases the various curriculum I have designed for my classes and provides links to instructional materials and grading rubrics. The resources here are as up-to-date as possible, and are based on my many years of experience as both a teacher and an engineer.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Bio-Molecular Science from the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, and a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University. My academic research focus was on signal processing for clinical neuroscience. I worked with the Neurological ICU at New-York Presbyterian Hospital as part of my research with Columbia University and then with the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University. My most recent publication was published in May 2020 on the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00449/full">Reactivation of Motor-Related Gamma Activity in Human NREM Sleep</a>. For a full list of my publications, please see my Linked In.
    <br>
    <br>
    My teaching career began when I volunteered to teach after school clubs like Girls Who Code, and lead bilingual workshops for Black Girls Code. I am passionate about creating grades 6-12 computer science and engineering pathways that are accessible to all students, and have presented my work at the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents conference as well as the Computer Science Teacher's Association New England conference.
